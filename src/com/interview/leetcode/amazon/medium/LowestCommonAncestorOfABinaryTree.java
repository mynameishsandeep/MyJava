Approach1: (Using 2 Traversal. By Storing root to n1 and root to n2 paths):
==========
Ex: LCA of 5 and 7 is 1. Following is simple O(n) algorithm to find LCA of n1 and n2.
1) Find path from root to n1(5) and store it in a list1. Ex: 1 2 (Don't store actual node itself)
2) Find path from root to n2 and store it in another list2. 1 3
3) Traverse from bottom of list2 whether it exists in list1. (list search is nSquare operation. so put it in set)
		So look for 3 in list1, not found
		look for 1 in list1, found and it is the answer.


Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above solution is O(n). The tree is traversed twice, and then path arrays are compared.

Approach2: (Using Single Traversal)
==========
The method 1 finds LCA in O(n) time, but requires three tree traversals plus extra spaces for path arrays.
If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are always present in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using single traversal of
Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays.
1) Traverse the tree starting from root.
2) If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with root, then root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present).
3) If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree.
4) The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in right subtree is the LCA.
If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.

		Ex1:	1		    Ex2:	1
				  2               2
				    3           3
				      4       4
		For above example. to find LCA of 2 and 4.
		recursion stops at 2. Because left is null and since is 2 is found, 4 must be below (assuming 4 present all time)
