*
* Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei),
* determine if a person could attend all meetings.
*
* BruteForce:
* The straight-forward solution is to compare every two meetings in the array,
* and see if they conflict with each other (i.e. if they overlap).
* Two meetings overlap if one of them starts while the other is still taking place.
*
* Optimum Approach:
* 0) Separate startTime and endTime in array.  
* 1) Sort startTime and endTime 
* 2) Iterate. Skip the first startTime, because there is no condition for it.
* 2) if, startTime of current is less than endTime of previous. Then false.

	Input: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]] Output: false
		startTime 	endTime
			0		   10
			5		   20
			15         30
