 *
 * Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei),
 * determine if a person could attend all meetings.
 *
 * BruteForce:
 * The straight-forward solution is to compare every two meetings in the array,
 * and see if they conflict with each other (i.e. if they overlap).
 * Two meetings overlap if one of them starts while the other is still taking place.
 *
 * Optimum Approach:
 * 1) Sort intervals by start time.
 * 2) if, startTime of current is less than endTime of previous. Then false.
