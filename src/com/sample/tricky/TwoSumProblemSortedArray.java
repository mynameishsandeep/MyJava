 * 1) Iterate from left and right. If the sum is greater then increment left else right.
 * Complexity is O(n)
 * 2) TwoSumProblem.java approach can be applied too....
 * 2) Approach 3, take a number do binarySearch for 2nd number.
 * Complexity is O(n*log(n)). But can be used based on requirement.
