/**
 * In an American football game, a play can lead to 2 points (safety), 3 points (field goal), 
 * or 7 points (touchdown, assuming the extra point). Many different combinations 
 * of 2, 3, and 7 point plays can make up a final score. For example, 
 * four combinations of plays yield a score of 12: 
 * 	1) 6 safeties (2x6 =12),
	2) 3 safeties and 2 field goals (2x3 + 3x2 =12), 
	3) 1safety,1fieldgoaland1touchdown(2xl+3xl+7xl =12),and 
	4) 4 field goals (3x4 =12).
