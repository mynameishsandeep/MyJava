/*
==============Bruce-force Algorithm===========
Solves a problem in the most simple, direct, or obvious way
• does not take advantage of structure or pattern in the problem
• usually involves exhaustive search of the solution space
• pro: often simple to implement
• con: usually not the most efficient way

==============Greedy Approach=================
Algorithm decides what is the best thing to do at each step
(local maxima), and never reconsiders its decisions
• pro: may run significantly faster than brute-force
• con: may not lead to the optimal (or even correct) solution (global maxima) Usually requires some initial pre-computation to set up the problem, to
take advantage of special structure/pattern in the problem or solution
space
==============================
Ex:
In minimum spanning tree find all permutations then pick small value is brute-force. It leads to TimeLimitException
Using Prims approach is Greedy.
