/*
 * 
substring is a continuous part or subpart of a string

whereas

subsequence is the part of a string or sequence, that might be continuous or not but the order of the elements is maintained

Example

let say str_a="hello there"

We further have the following strings:

str_b="hello", str_c="ello th", str_d="hllo", str_e="ho hre", str_f="there hello"

str_b is a substring of str_a, str_c is also a substring of str_a but str_d is not a substring of str_a as this substring is not continuous.

Now all subtrings are subsequences as the order is maintained.

str_d is a subsequence of str_a, str_e is also a subsequence of str_a however str_f is not a subsequence of str_a as in this case the order is not maintained.
